## Description

My motivation for this project was to learn the basics of HTML,CSS, Git and JavaScript so i can take this knowledge into my work as a Product Analyst. I use Git on a daily bases as a Product Analyst but had no idea how a pull request is completed and why we need to check that previous branches are all up to date on the command lines. This project has also given me a clear understanding of how the HTML, CSS and JavaScrpit code is used to create a website and how certain elements of the code have to be placed in a certain order for the code to work. I have always had a passion for coding but not been able to make time to learn, after working with the front end developers on a daily bases I have realised that I really enjoy debugging and working through codes to spot patterns, errors etc. This is a great way for me to learn and put into practice immediately.
